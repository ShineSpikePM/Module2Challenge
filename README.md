There were a few parts in the assignment that I did have to look up how to make it work.
For some reason the worksheets function would not work and run in each sheet.
The Autofit I learned that using EntireColumn would make the whole column fit the largest text.
For the extra table of the min max and largest, Application.WorksheetFunction.Max was the only way i could get it to work and look through the rows for the amounts.
I believe the only part of the assignment that does not work is the loop through each sheet, but the macro can be run in each sheet to get the results of the macro.
